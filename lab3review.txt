Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas'
  AND city != 'Duluth'
  AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


7. List all data for orders in January or March.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


9. List all orders from the customer whose cid is C005.

Incorrect output
- You are not listing the orders, but customer info!


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
